# Waiter Tips (Case Study)

The food server of a restaurant recorded data about the tips given to the waiters for serving the food. The data recorded by the food server is as follows:

1. total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes
2. tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars
3. sex: gender of the person paying the bill
4. smoker: whether the person smoked or not
5. day: day of the week
6. time: lunch or dinner
7. size: number of people in a table 

So this is the data recorded by the restaurant. Based on this data, our task is to find the factors affecting waiter tips and train a machine learning model to predict the waiterâ€™s tipping.
